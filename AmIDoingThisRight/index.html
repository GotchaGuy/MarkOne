	<p>I was about to make a img tag but like I don't even think you're going to check what this says so..if you are reading this, you already checked the other homework and saw those 2 panda pictures. Greg is on the first one, and Kevin is on the second one. Pretty chill dudes tbh. Kevin is a madman if you give him too much bamboo beer though, so be careful (yes, bamboo beer is a thing).</p>
